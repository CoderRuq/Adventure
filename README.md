# Adventure

This repository contains what I hope to be my first pinnicle python project: A full-fledged video game!
The concept is to pay tribute to a classic video game that still manages to capture my attention despite its simplicity: The Atari 2600's "Adventure".
I want to recapture the wonder of that game, but also add onto it, with new gameplay.

In reality this project may end up being a burning pile of garbage given my novice programming skills, but one can hope.

This repository makes use of python 3, and the python arcade library (arcade.academy).
